- 👋 Hi, I’m @louiethelip

- 👀 Right now, I'm interested in learning how to code enough to build a website, just to keep
 the old brain creating new neuronal pathways and try to avoid, (for as long as I can) the oncoming  
 dementia and the inevitable Alzheimer’s that follows. 
 
 I’m currently trying to work my way through Angela Yu's The Complete 2022 Web Development tutorials
 and after much struggle and looking for hair to pull out! I have managed to put up a front page of
 My personal web site including my profile pic. 
 
 💞️ I’m hoping to collaborate with some kindly mentors for some advice here on the Hub, when I get stuck
    with the codes that I'm working on. You see the thing is at my advanced stage of life, (the geriatric stage)
    it’s difficult to learn new tricks, plus the fact that I'm profoundly deaf only confuses things further.

- 📫 How to reach me unfortunately as we are advised by the Hub that we shouldn't divulge our email addresses
-    when we are discussing on the Hub and as my web site is yet incomplete, I fear the GitHub is my only
-    means of contact for now, until my web site is up and running.
